     \itemize{
          \item We added functions to automatically download and process methylation and gene expression data from TCGA.
          \item We added functions to cluster CpG sites into gene clusters.
          \item All the functionality can be run in parallel.
          \item We implemented ggplot2 plots for graphical representation.
          \item We added some arguments (e.g. listOfGenes, filter, etc.) to gain flexibility in the analysis.

     \itemize{
          \item This marks the first release to BioConductor of MethylMix. We 
          included two data sets to test MethylMix: a glioblastoma and breast 
          cancer data set. We have included one vignettes which uses a breast 
          cancer example to show the functionality of MethylMix.
