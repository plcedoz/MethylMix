Title: MethylMix: Identifying methylation driven cancer genes.
Author: Olivier Gevaert
Maintainer: Olivier Gevaert <olivier.gevaert@gmail.com>
Description: MethylMix is an algorithm implemented to identify hyper
        and hypomethylated genes for a disease. MethylMix is based on a
        beta mixture model to identify methylation states and compares
        them with the normal DNA methylation state. MethylMix uses a
        novel statistic, the Differential Methylation value or DM-value
        defined as the difference of a methylation state with the
        normal methylation state. Finally, matched gene expression data
        is used to identify, besides differential, functional
        methylation states by focusing on methylation changes that
        effect gene expression.
